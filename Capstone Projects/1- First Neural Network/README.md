# Bicycle Sales Prediction

-- Built a multi-layer neural network with Python and NumPy. The Neural network was built from "scratch", using only NumPy to assist.

-- Explored concepts of gradient descent, forward and backward propagation, and experimented with several combination of hyper-parameters for predicting number of bikeshare users.

-- The goal of this project was to understand what happens behind the neural network before diving deeper into other tools like TensorFlow.
