# Natural Language Processing Model

-- Built a Recurrent Neural Network and Long-short term memory neural network with scikit-learn and Tensorflow to process text, perform sentiment analysis, generate new text/episodes of TV show from old scripts and to translate language.

-- The concepts of embedding (word2vec), batch normalization and seq2seq learning were applied to reach the desired accuracy.
