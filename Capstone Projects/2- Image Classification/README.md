# Image Classification

-- Built a convolutional neural network by applying the concepts such as max pooling and dropout to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset.

-- The strategy of normalizing the images and one-hot encoding the labels was applied before training the CNN on sample data set.

-- The project was written in Python (on a Jupyter Notebook) using the libraries numpy, pickle and tensorflow, running on an Anaconda environment.

-- Furthermore, the network was trained using FloydHub platform as a cloud-GPU.
